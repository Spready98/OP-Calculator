A calculator for the Odin-Project!
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

My calculator rounds its calculations to two decimal points to ensure numbers do not run off the edge of the display. Users can use multiple operators, however the calculator will "on-the-fly" calculate the first expression before using the result in the next calculation. Therefore, it does not really follow BEDMAS in terms of priorities in order of operation. Feel free to use the keyboard as it is also supported. 

Due to the nature of my code and the functionality guidelines, there were several bugs involving saving numbers/decimals and making sure the right numbers were being calculated. In the future, I would like to use regex for the numbers and have proper order of operation priority.
